# Virtual-Keyboard using JAVA

# 1. Introduction
Virtual keyboard is a software based input device that allows user to input text or command without using physical keyboard. It appears on display screen like smartphone, tablet and computer monitor. 
I have created this virtual keyboard in java Swing that provides users with graphical user interface for typing texts and inserting emojis.
